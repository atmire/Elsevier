# DSpace Elsevier patch

## Introduction

[Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com) is a global information analytics company that helps institutions and professionals progress science, advance healthcare and improve performance. This patch offers enhancements for DSpace 5 and 6 that leverage Elsevier's APIs for ScienceDirect, Scopus and PubMed for following use cases:

* Importing publication metadata at the start of a new submission
* Batch importing several publications at once, either as archived items or as workflow items
* Batch enrichment of existing items in the repository through command line scripts
* Embedded viewing of the publication in the repository. A user can read the publication without leaving the repository.
* See a publication's open access status automatically on the repository item page
* Enhancement of the DSpace file upload step to more easily enter embargo information

You can watch a [demo](https://youtu.be/ye2V-nU5qbw) showcasing some of the features.

The DSpace Elsevier API integration patch has been developed and is maintained by [Atmire](https://www.atmire.com), a registered service provider for DSpace.

## Conditions for use

Using this integration does not require a paid subscription to any of Elsevier's commercial services. The key condition for using this API is that the link to the record of the publication on ScienceDirect/Scopus/PubMed should be prominently visible on the publication's page in the repository.
