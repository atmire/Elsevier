# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests (PR).

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Extensively make use of comments describing your custom code blocks.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, please send multiple pull requests.

- **Send a coherent Git history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

**Happy coding**!
